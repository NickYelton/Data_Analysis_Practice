# Portfolio_Projects

This is my portfolio of projects that showcase my knowledge and abilities in data analysis using commonplace tools like Python, SQL, and Tableau.

## SQL Analysis

The SQL projects make use of COVID-19 pulled from the CDC website and demonstrate data cleaning and EDA techniques using joins, temp tables, and views.

## Python

Rather than using Python for data cleaning and EDA, I decided to use Python and the Pandas library to experiment with finding correlations in the already cleaned data.
This allowed me to practice Pandas and Numpy with a more defined purpose instead of using the libraries to query the dataset like with SQL. I also used Python and the
Scrapy library to build a webscraper that crawled the web for product information like price and name to use for data visualization.

## Data Viz

I use Tableau to visualize any and all data from my projects as it's one of the leading tools in the data industry for visualization.
